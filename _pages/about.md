I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/). My research interests includes Quantum information, Quantum computation, Computational Complexity and Logic.

I'm also a percussionist in the school symphony orchestra NJUSO. The photo of my github profile is the Canadian composer [Claude Vivier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Vivier), you can listen to some of his excellent works here: [Wo bist du Licht!](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Xu411r7Nb/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=f3d27190d892d4bb12543b96f45d1cca) [Lonely Child](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ds411b7xR/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=f3d27190d892d4bb12543b96f45d1cca).
